# World-Of-Gensokyo-Touhou-Mod
*A ruleset Touhou mod that takes place in a world - set in Japanese mythology - called Gensokyo. This mod is still in it's early and experimental form, I wish you enjoy it! (Visit the GitHub page for more info)*

Apparently, this mod was made entirely with a phone, and since that it is, it will take longer to update changes than normal. There are still a lot of ~~touhou moes~~ totally necessary things to add and change, because the mod isn't really properly playtested yet.

That's it for the lore. You can visit my thread for the discussion of this mod in the official Unciv discord server... and enjoy!
Have a great day
