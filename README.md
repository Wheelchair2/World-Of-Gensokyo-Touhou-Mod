# World-Of-Gensokyo-Touhou-Mod
*A ruleset Touhou mod that takes place in a world - set in Japanese mythology - called Gensokyo. This mod is still in it's early and experimental form, I wish you enjoy it! (Visit the GitHub page for more info)*

There are still a lot of ~~touhou moes~~ totally necessary things to add and change, because the mod isn't really properly playtested yet. However, the mod is developing pretty rapidly thanks to the helpful contribution for the mod. After all, anybody can do anything if it's for cute anime gir-

That's it for the lore. You can visit my thread for the discussion of this mod in the official Unciv discord server... and enjoy!
Have a great day
